# The Future of Vertical SaaS

The low-hanging fruit in horizontal SaaS (CRM, Email, Project Management) has been picked. Salesforce, HubSpot, and Asana have won. The next wave of value creation lies in **Vertical SaaS**.

## The Vertical Advantage

Horizontal software solves a broad problem for everyone. Vertical software solves *every* problem for someone.

> "Deep integration allows for multiple wedges into a business."

When you control the entire operating system for a vertical (e.g., Toast for restaurants, Procore for construction), you can layer on fintech, payroll, and supply chain management. This increases LTV and makes the product incredibly sticky.

## Fintech is the Catalyst

The real unlock for vertical SaaS is embedded finance. By processing payments, lending capital, or managing insurance, vertical SaaS companies can monetize GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), not just seats.

# Systems Thinking via First Principles

Most people reason by analogy. "We'll do X because our competitor did X." This is a recipe for incrementalism, not innovation.

## The First Principles Approach

First principles thinking requires you to boil things down to the most fundamental truths and then reason up from there.

1.  **Deconstruct**: Break the problem down into its basic elements.
2.  **Verify**: Ensure these elements are factual, not assumed.
3.  **Reconstruct**: Build a solution from the ground up.

## Applying to Organizations

When I look at a broken process, I don't ask "How do we fix this step?" I ask "Why does this process exist in the first place?".

# Engineering Culture in Marketing

Why do engineering teams often execute faster and with higher quality than marketing teams? It's not IQ. It's the **operating system**.

## Borrowed Concepts

*   **Version Control**: Marketing assets should be versioned, not overwritten.
*   **CI/CD**: Campaigns should be tested in isolation before being deployed to the main audience.
*   **Retrospectives**: Every sprint should end with a blameless post-mortem.
*   **Documentation**: If it's not documented, it didn't happen.

By treating marketing campaigns as "products" rather than "tasks", we increase accountability and long-term velocity.

# The Art of the Pivot

A pivot is a change in strategy without a change in vision.

## When to Pivot?

The hardest part is knowing *when*. Too early, and you haven't given your idea a chance. Too late, and you run out of runway.

### The Signal

The clearest signal is **segment retention**. If *anyone* is retaining, you have a product. You just might have the wrong market. If *no one* is retaining, you have a product problem.

> "Pivot on the market before you pivot on the product."

Find the users who *are* sticking around. Who are they? What do they have in common? Double down on them.
